discord bot to render videos in ascii / .txt format (sends each video frame as a message)
dimension : w = 70 h = 22 characters 2.57 aspect ratio 

usage/commands:
&frames <ur youtube video link> -> starts render the video and messages ascii txt back
&stop or &end to stop the bot

bugs/problems:
the renderer outputs frames in batches of 5 and the correct framerate and then pauses for a moment (no idea why it does this)
it has something to do with openCV and the way videos are process have I B and P frames or delta frames from whats online

fix in progress
